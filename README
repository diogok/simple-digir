SimpleDigir

This is a PHP library, php webservice wrapper and simple interface for performing searchs on DIGIR services.

DIGIR is a (old, bad and ugly) protocol for interchange of biological data in the Darwin Core format, and it's widely adopted. A nice list of Digir servers can be found at http://bigdig.ecoforge.net/wiki/ProviderStatus .

This library provides a wrapper for easily performing search on a digir server.

Usage:

<?php
$records = SimpleDigir::create($urlOfTheServer)->setResource('GBIF')->filter("ScientificName","like","Quercus%")->getResult();
foreach($records as $record) {
    echo $record->Species ;
}
?>

By now only the PHP Library is implemented, supporting only one parameter/filter per query.
